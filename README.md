In your Spring Boot application for unit conversion, you’ve used several Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts and SOLID principles. Here’s a detailed breakdown:
OOP Concepts Used

    Encapsulation:
        What It Is: Encapsulation involves bundling the data (fields) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, typically a class.
        How You’ve Used It:
            The ConversionInput class encapsulates the data related to conversion (e.g., fromUnit, toUnit, and value).
            The DistanceConversion and TemperatureConversion classes encapsulate the logic for converting distances and temperatures, respectively.

    Abstraction:
        What It Is: Abstraction involves hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object.
        How You’ve Used It:
            The Converter interface provides an abstract method convert that all conversion classes must implement. The details of the conversion logic are hidden behind this interface.
            The ConversionController abstracts away the details of how conversions are performed and only exposes endpoints for performing conversions.

    Inheritance:
        What It Is: Inheritance allows a class to inherit properties and methods from another class or interface.
        How You’ve Used It:
            The DistanceConversion and TemperatureConversion classes implement the Converter interface. This means they inherit the contract (methods) defined by the Converter interface and provide specific implementations for the conversion logic.

    Polymorphism:
        What It Is: Polymorphism allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class or interface, enabling the same method to be used in different ways.
        How You’ve Used It:
            By using the Converter interface, you can call the convert method on different conversion classes (like DistanceConversion and TemperatureConversion) through a common interface. This allows you to use different conversion logic interchangeably.

SOLID Principles Used

    Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):
        What It Is: A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one responsibility.
        How You’ve Used It:
            The ConversionInput class has the sole responsibility of holding conversion-related data.
            The DistanceConversion and TemperatureConversion classes each handle only their specific type of conversion.
            The ConversionController is responsible only for handling HTTP requests and invoking the appropriate conversion logic.

    Open/Closed Principle (OCP):
        What It Is: Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification.
        How You’ve Used It:
            The Converter interface allows new types of conversions to be added (by implementing new classes) without modifying the existing controller logic.
            You can add new conversion types (e.g., volume conversions) by creating new implementation classes and adding new endpoints in the controller, without changing the existing code.

    Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):
        What It Is: Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without altering the correctness of the program.
        How You’ve Used It:
            Classes like DistanceConversion and TemperatureConversion can be used wherever the Converter interface is expected. They adhere to the contract defined by the Converter interface, ensuring they can be substituted without breaking the functionality.

    Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):
        What It Is: Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. Interfaces should be specific to the needs of the clients.
        How You’ve Used It:
            The Converter interface is designed to be general and reusable for different types of conversions. Each specific conversion class implements only the methods it needs from the Converter interface.

    Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):
        What It Is: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions (e.g., interfaces). Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.
        How You’ve Used It:
            The ConversionController depends on the Converter interface rather than specific conversion classes. This allows you to change the implementation of Converter without modifying the controller.

By applying these OOP concepts and SOLID principles, your code is more modular, maintainable, and flexible. If you have any more questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask!
